# Web Page for Marca Café

### Explanation

* My first real life project as a freelancer, 4 months after starting studies on IT field.

* The job was required by a brazilian coffee exportation company, located in Espírito Santo (one of the southeast estates in Brazil).

* Firstly, I thinked in the whole design structure by analysing the company style and their logo colors. Secondly, started to code the web page with pure HTML, CSS and JS.

* The page includes six sections: Home; Business; About; Address; Contact and Legal Publications.

* Responsiveness available for mobile, laptops and fullHD monitors.

Note 1: the contact form was made with an API endpoint that you can connect to a HTML form in order to handle form submission, since I
don't have enough knowledge on backend yet;

Note 2: if you translate the page with google translator extension on Chrome the header menu navigation stops working.

### Result
* You can check the result at: https://www.marcacafe.com.br
